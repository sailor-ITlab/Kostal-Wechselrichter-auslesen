# Kostal-Wechselrichter-auslesen
## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to read out two alternating lights in my home ("Wechselr_Keller" and "Wechselr_Gartenhaus"), process and calculate this data and then make it available via an API.

Please note that this code has grown over several years and I have placed little value on code optimization, but rather on functionality.
Also, many comments and other names are in German.

The required Python modules are stored in the "used_modules.txt".
